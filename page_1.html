                <h3>Unification of China by Qin Shi Huang</h3>
                <p>
                The historical background of the Terracotta Warriors can be traced 
                back to 221 B.C., when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified the various 
                Warring States Period states in China and established China's first 
                empire, the Qin Dynasty. The political unification of this period 
                had a profound impact on Chinese history.

                <h3>Qin Shi Huang's Tomb</h3>
                <p>
                    The Terracotta Warriors and Horses were discovered in the tomb
                     of Qin Shi Huang, one of the largest ancient tombs in China. 
                     Its construction reflects the power and ruling ambitions of 
                     the First Qin Emperor, as well as the scale and complexity of 
                     imperial tombs in ancient China.

                <p>
                    The Terracotta Warriors are considered to symbolize courtly culture
                    and the military power of the Qin Dynasty. These terracotta figures 
                    represent the army and court under the reign of Qin Shi Huang, 
                    revealing the organization and military strategy of ancient Chinese 
                    society.
