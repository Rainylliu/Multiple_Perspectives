                <h3>Preservation and restoration techniques</h3>
                <p>
                    Techniques for the conservation and restoration of terracotta 
                    warriors are also an important scientific and technological 
                    aspect. Due to the size and complexity of these terracotta
                    warriors, preserving them from the effects of time and natural 
                    erosion requires advanced technologies and methods. Scientists 
                    and engineers are constantly working to develop new methods to 
                    ensure the preservation and restoration of the Terracotta Warriors.

                <h3>Technological displays</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Terracotta Warriors Museum, visitors can better understand 
                    these ancient works through a variety of interactive displays and 
                    multimedia technologies. The use of technology allows visitors to 
                    gain a deeper understanding of the history of the Terracotta Warriors 
                    and the stories behind them.

                <h3>Research and Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Advances in modern technology have also helped to study the Terracotta 
                    Warriors in depth. Through the use of non-invasive techniques such as 
                    laser scanning and X-ray imaging, the internal structure and composition 
                    of these terracotta warriors can be analyzed in greater detail. These 
                    analyses help reveal more information about their production process and 
                    history.
